                    We walk, the two of us, through the autumn day.<br>                    
                    And in spring too I feel no different. <br>
                    We walk through much brown tavern-brown of leaves <br>
                    through much dark-red loss, appellation control√©e, <br>

                </p>
                <p>
                    that deepens in the cellar of the years. <br>
                    We walk through the beiger-turning woods of Drente. <br>
                    Hear the wind passing through the hennaed trees <br>
                    sounding like an oboe, tramp among instruments. <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    33, and in the midst of the dark wood <br>
                    of life. And with a sense of nowhere belonging, <br>
                    at home in the woods and desolate at home. <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Will we one day, maybe, ever? <br>
                    The summer is past, the hay-making is over. <br>
                    The here is nowhere, and the now is never. <br>
